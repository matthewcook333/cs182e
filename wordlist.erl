% load/1
% input: path to dictionary file.
% output: a list containing the word in the dictionary file.
% details:  if error occurs in opening file or reading input, 
%  the resulting list is empty. Assumes the dictionary file 
%  describes one word per line.

% distance/3
% input: word x, word y, and integer threshold t.
% output: a distance between x and y up to threshold t.
% details:  if the distance is greater than t, this function
%  returns some integer greater than t.

% input: word w and list of words L.
% output: true if w appears in L and false otherwise.

% suggestions/2
% input: word w and list of words L.
% output: a list containing all the suggested spellings for w that appear
%  in L in alphabetical order.
% details:  if there are no suggested spellings for w, returns empty list
suggestions(w, L) ->

% main/1
% input: a list with only one element which is the pathname of dictionary
%  file (written as main([Pathname]).
% output: prints results of correct and suggestions for each word user types
% details:  this allows the user to repeatedly enter words (one per line) 
%  until the EOF character (Control-D) is entered.
